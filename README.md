## Week 1: NET PROGRAM
### - Objectives
oAt the end of the period the students should be able to know the VB.NET language and how to write and run a Console Application in this language.

### - Introduction
There are two ways to build programs in VB.NET. One is to use the Visual Studio.NET Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The other is to use the command-line compiler packaged as part of the .NET Framework Software Development Kit (SDK).

With VB.NET, you can write many different kinds of programs. A VB.NET program that makes use of a graphical user interface (GUI) is a Windows application. A VB.NET program that uses the command-prompt console for input and output is called a Console application. You can also write Internet applications, Windows Services applications, and other types of applications.
